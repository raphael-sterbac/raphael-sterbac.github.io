I am a Master's student in Computer Science at ENS Paris-Saclay, interested in Type theory, Logic and Programming languages.

# Experience

- Research Intern, University of Cambridge (5 months)
    + Under the supervision of Jon Sterling
    + Will focus on the foundational design and implementation of a new streamlined proof
    assistant based on homotopy type theory. Implementation of a new presentation for cumulative universes, and study of its semantics in ∞-categories.

- Research Intern, Chalmers University of Technology (2 months)
    + Under the supervision of Thierry Coquand.
    + Syntax and semantics of dependent type theory: proving normalisation semantically with the Artin glueing technique, proving the equivalence of Tarski and Russell presentations for cumulative universes.
    + Talk at TYPES 2026

# Education

- ENS Paris-Saclay : Computer Science and Mathematics (2024-2028)
- Lycée Montaigne : French "Classes préparatoires" (2022-2024)
